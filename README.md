# Graphics-2 Collaborated Project (C++ / OpenGL)

This repository contains a C++ graphics project developed as part of my
University of Leeds Graphics 2-person coursework.

## Overview
- Implemented core linear algebra operations (vectors, matrices, transforms)
- Built a basic rendering pipeline using C++
- Worked with shaders (GLSL) and low-level graphics concepts
- Focused on performance, correctness, and structured code design

## Technologies
- C++
- OpenGL / GLSL
- Custom math library (matrices, vectors)
- Premake build system

## What this demonstrates
- Systems-level programming in C++
- Mathematical reasoning applied to graphics
- Managing a multi-file codebase
- Debugging and incremental development

## Notes
This project was developed under time constraints as part of assessed
coursework and prioritised correctness and functionality.
